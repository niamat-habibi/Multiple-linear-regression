# 📊 Multiple Linear Regression: Marketing Promotions Analysis

## 📝 Project Overview
This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** to analyze a small business's historical marketing promotion data. The objective is to estimate sales based on different marketing channels, including **TV, social media, radio, and influencer promotions**. This analysis helps the business identify the most impactful channels to optimize their marketing strategy.

## 📂 Dataset Description
- 📥 **Dataset Link**: [Download the dataset here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWQfmdeW83BXIgXCDQHPxPLczmcv55Fs/view?usp=sharing)
- 📌 The dataset contains independent marketing promotions and their effect on sales.
- 📌 Features include spending on **TV, radio, social media, and influencer promotions**.
- 📌 The target variable is **sales**, representing revenue generated per campaign.
- 📌 Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, outlier detection, and exploratory analysis.

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps
1. 🛠 **Importing Libraries**: Utilizing Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
2. 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding distributions, correlations, and potential feature relationships.
3. 🔧 **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and standardizing numerical features.
4. 📈 **Feature Selection**: Choosing relevant variables based on statistical tests and visualization.
5. 🏗 **Building the Model**: Training a **Multiple Linear Regression** model using Scikit-learn.
6. 📉 **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using **R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and residual analysis**.
7. 🎯 **Business Insights**: Interpreting model outputs and recommending marketing optimization strategies.

## 🔍 Results & Insights
- ✅ The **Multiple Linear Regression** model showed a strong relationship between marketing spend and sales.
- ✅ **Social media and TV promotions** had the highest impact on sales, while radio had minimal effect.
- ✅ The model met key regression assumptions, with normally distributed residuals and no significant multicollinearity issues.
- ✅ The findings suggest that the business should **prioritize social media and TV ads for higher ROI** while reconsidering spending on radio ads.
